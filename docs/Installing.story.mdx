# Installing

You can install REALAYERS with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/realayers) or Yarn.

- NPM: `npm install realayers --save`
- YARN: `yarn add realayers`

## Compatibility

REALAYERS is compatible with React v16+ and works with ReactDOM. React Native is not supported at this time.

## Developing

If you want to run the project locally, its really easy!

The project uses Storybook for its demos and development
environment. To run it locally:

- Clone repo
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

Once started the browser will open to the storybook url.
From here you can tweak components and see them build
and reload in real time.

We use Rollup to build and package for distribution.
You can run this by doing `yarn build` and it will
create a `dist` folder with the type definitions, bundled
javascript and css files.
